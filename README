# Green Harvest

A library that aims to provide a singular interface to state cannabis licensing data. It abstracts the details around fetching and parsing the license documents into a format that can easily be imported into a database for further analysis

The library is currently split into two modules; scrapers.py and parsers.py

## scrapers.py

scrapers.py provides a generic scraping class that handles about 90% of the logic of extracting the download links, fetching the files, and saving them to disk. It also provides classes configured to download data from several states.

## parsers.py

parsers.py intends to provide a similar unified interface for extracting data from the files downloaded. Only Colorado is currently implemented.
